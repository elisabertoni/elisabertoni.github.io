        <h3>That time I was blocked on a simple problem...</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Superfizzbuzz BOOM!</h3>
        <p>
          I was stuck on the “Superfizzbuzz” challenge for quite a while and ended up 
          solving it with a long syntax using a for loop. 
          <br>A couple of days after I was randomly watching a video where Joseph was using 
          the map() built-in function to solve another exercise. All of a sudden it all clicked 
          and I realized that maybe I could have simply used that for the “Superfizzbuzz” 
          challenge. So I went back to my code and tried it and boom, it worked! 
          It felt super good and I felt empowered like a superhero! 
        </p>
        <h3>Problem-solving techniques I have been using:</h3>
        <div class="blog-ul">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong>: pretty confident and I actually use this technique very often.</li>
            <li><strong>Trying something </strong>: way too confident. I probably use this method way too much.</li>
            <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>: not so confident. Talking out loud definitely helps me, but I only use it if I am alone in the room. I would never do it in the office!</li>
            <li><strong>Reading error messages </strong>: sort of confident. Being able to read and interpretate error messages can be super helpful as they can point you to the right direction. </li>
            <li><strong>Console.logging </strong>: I am confident with it but I don’t use it that often, unsure why. SO maybe I am not as confident with this as I think?!?</li>
            <li><strong>Googling </strong>: I am confident with it but I don’t use it that often, unsure why. So maybe I am not as confident with this as I think?!?</li>
            <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>: not so confident. I am quite shy when I don’t really know someone and it doesn’t come easy to ask strangers for help. I am try to get more confident at this and I have reached out to couple of girls in my cohort this week.</li>
            <li><strong>Asking coaches for help </strong>: not so confident. Same reason as above.</li>
            <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>: something in-between probably. Reflection is something I never really used before starting Dev Academy. I have now understood how important it can be to retain information, so I should probably use this technique more.</li>
          </ul>
