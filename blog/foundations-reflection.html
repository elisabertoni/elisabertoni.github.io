        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I have a fixed mindset and this is mainly due to the way I was brought up. 
          This can change though and I am very committed to try and shift my mindset 
          to a more growth perspective.   
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a very independent person and I don’t like asking for help. 
          I rather cry all afternoon because I am not able to solve a challenge 
          than asking for help. This is not good, I know!
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew this already. I don’t like being vulnerable and I don’t enjoy 
          to speak about my inner self. I have felt uncomfortable in some occasions 
          during Foundations when I had to share my thoughts and my blogs with everyone. 
        </p>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The fact that I enjoyed the topics covered during the core learning 
          has been the real surprise for me. I have never been exposed to those 
          concepts before and I have the feeling that I have now changed the way I see 
          certain things thanks to core material.
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
          Writing the blogs has been the hardest part of the core learning. Researching 
          and learning about the core topics was so useful, but writing those blog 
          has taken me a lot of time. 
          <br>Writing and putting my thoughts into words doesn’t come easily to me, 
          so every time is a long and tedious process. I go back and forth hundreds 
          of times and I am never happy with what I wrote. This has made me quite 
          frustrated at times as I was spending way more time doing core and 
          reflections than coding. 
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
          A lot of programmers work in team, so being able to interact with other 
          people is an essential skill for a developer to have. Recent researches 
          have showed that a greater number of employers would rather hire someone 
          with excellent core skills and minimal tech knowledge, than a person who 
          has a great technical background but lack of human skills. 
        </p>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h3>
        <p>
          I have to admit that at the beginning of Foundations I felt quite annoyed 
          about the whole core learning thing. Now, I absolutely don’t think that 
          core learning is a waste of time, although I do think that there is way 
          too many reflections to do. Some of the questions asked are really repetitive 
          and could be avoided. I have enjoyed learning about the core concepts 
          but at the same time writing the blogs have been really time consuming 
          and I felt I was spending half of my week doing core and I didn’t dedicate 
          enough time to coding, which is the primary reason I am here for.
