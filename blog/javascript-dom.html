        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>Javascript is a programming language that is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like apps, games and browsers.</p>
        <p>JavaScript makes web pages dynamic. Before JavaScript, web pages were built only with HTML and CSS and those two together are only capable of creating static pages. Yes, you can style with CSS but there is no interactivity.</p>
        <p>As of 2022 JavaScript is the most commonly-used language in the world, and it's no surprise that some of the most popular websites are built with JavaScript, including Google, YouTube, and Facebook.</p>
        <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
        <p>In my previous reflections I compared a website to a house. <em>HTML</em> is like the structural elements of a house, the starting point. <em>CSS</em> is anything to do with the styling and design of the house, like painting it and adding furniture. <em>JavaScript</em> is adding interactivity, and that would be adding the electricity and heating to the house. 
        </p>
        <p>Another analogy that I love and itâ€™s often used online is that if we were to compare HTML, CSS and JavaScript to real-life jobs, then HTML would be a builder, CSS an artist and JavaScript would definitely be a magician because it is responsible of creating action in a website .
        </p>

        <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h3>
        <p>In computer programming, control flow is the order in which the code gets executed by the computer. The code generally runs line by line from top to bottom, unless the computer hits any statement or structure that changes the control flow, such as functions, conditionals or loops.
        </p>
        <p><strong><em>Loops</em></strong> are a conditional statement that repeats the given task until the given condition is met. This means that the loop will keep running until there is either nothing left to loop over, or if the condition becomes false. Loops are also known as iteration statements.
        </p>
        <p>There many types of loops in JavaScript but the main commons are: </p>
          <div class="blog-ul">
            <ul>
              <li><strong>For</strong></li>
              <li><strong>While</strong></li>
              <li><strong>forEach</strong></li>
              <li><strong>For of</strong></li>
           </ul>
          </div>
        <p>The <strong><em>for</em></strong> loop is one of the most commonly used loop structures in most programming languages, not just JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
        <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.</p>
        <h3>Array vs. Objects</h3>
        <h3>Functions?</h3>
        <p>A function is a piece of code that if needed can be used multiple times in a program. When developing an application, you often need to perform the same action over and over, and to avoid repeating the same code multiple times, you can use a function to wrap that code and reuse it as many times you need.
        </p>
        <p>A function is declared using the <code>function</code> keyword and to use it you need to call it. Calling a function is also known as invoking a function. To call a function, you use its name followed by arguments enclosing in parentheses.
        </p>
        <p>Function syntax:
        
        </p>
        <p>The terms <strong>parameters</strong> and <strong>arguments</strong> are often used interchangeably. However, they are essentially different. When declaring a function, you specify the parameters, while when calling a function, you pass the arguments that are corresponding to the parameters.
        </p>
        <p>I find the function concept very similar to adding new phone numbers to our contact list (= creating the function). E.g. Every time I want to call my mum, instead of keying her number, I type mum from my contact list (this will be equal to calling the function mum() ). 
        </p>
