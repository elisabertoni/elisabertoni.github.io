        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>
          Javascript is a programming language that is used by programmers across 
          the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like apps, games and browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript makes web pages dynamic. Before JavaScript, web pages were built 
          only with HTML and CSS and those two together are only capable of creating static pages. 
          Yes, you can style with CSS but there is no interactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 2022 JavaScript is the most commonly-used language in the world, 
          and it's no surprise that some of the most popular websites are built with JavaScript, 
          including Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
        </p>
        <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
        <p>
          In my previous reflections I compared a website to a house. <em>HTML</em> 
          is like the structural elements of a house, the starting point. <em>CSS</em> 
          is anything to do with the styling and design of the house, like painting 
          it and adding furniture. <em>JavaScript</em> is adding interactivity, 
          and that would be adding electricity and heating to the house. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Another analogy that I love and it’s often used online is that if we were to compare HTML, 
          CSS and JavaScript to real-life jobs, then HTML would be a builder, CSS an artist 
          and JavaScript would definitely be a magician because it is responsible of creating action in a website .
        </p>

        <h3>Explain control flow and loops.</h3>
        <p>
          In computer programming, control flow is the order in which the code gets executed by the computer. 
          The code generally runs line by line from top to bottom, unless the computer hits any statement 
          or structure that changes the control flow, such as functions, conditionals or loops.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Loops</em></strong> are a conditional statement that repeats 
          the given task until the given condition is met. This means that a loop will 
          keep running until there is either nothing left to loop over, or if the condition becomes false. 
          Loops are also known as iteration statements.
        </p>
        <p>There many types of loops in JavaScript but the main commons are: </p>
          <div class="blog-ul">
            <ul>
              <li><strong>For</strong></li>
              <li><strong>While</strong></li>
              <li><strong>forEach</strong></li>
              <li><strong>For of</strong></li>
           </ul>
          </div>
        <p>
          The <strong><em>for</em></strong> loop is one of the most commonly used loop 
          structures in most programming languages, not just JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you first start coding loops are very intimidating but you will be 
          surprised to know that your everyday life is full of loops too!
        </p>
        <p>
          For example: let’s say that you work Monday to Friday and you have to 
          be in the office at 8.30am on those days. As a consequence you set up your alarm 
          to ring every weekday at 7am. Every morning your alarm check which day of the week 
          it is, and if it’s any day between Monday to Friday, then it will go off, 
          otherwise (Saturday or Sunday) it won’t ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we translate this into JavaScript, your code will look something like this:
        </p>

        <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
        <p>
          To explain in simple English what the DOM is I am going to borrow an analogy from
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dom-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-document-object-model/">FreeCodeCamp</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <div class="separation">...</div>
          <div class="story">"Imagine this: you have the TV on but you don't like 
            the show that's being streamed, and you want to change channel.
            <br>How can you do that?<br>
            There has to be a way for you to interact with your television. And what do you use to do that?
            <br>
            A remote.
            <br>
            The remote serves as the bridge which allows you interact with your television. 
            You make the TV active and dynamic via the remote.
            And in the same way, JavaScript makes the HTML page active and dynamic via the DOM."
          </div>
          <div class="separation">...</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface 
          that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. 
          We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.
          We can access these elements in the document and make changes to them using JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example we can use the syntax <code>document.querySelectorAll("p");</code> 
          to return a list of all the paragraph elements ("p") in the document:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/DOM.png" alt="document.querySelectorAll(paragraph)" class="img-center">
        <h3>Array vs. Objects</h3>
        <p>
          Arrays and objects are two ways of collecting data into a group. 
          Let's try to understand what is the difference between the two and 
          when you should use one rather than the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <strong>array</strong> is an ordered collection of data and arrays are used 
          to store a list of multiple values in a single variable. Each of those value 
          is called an element and every element has a number attached to it, called a
          numeric index, that allows us to access it. In JavaScript, arrays start at index 
          zero and array can be manipulated with various methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          An array can hold values of mixed types, this means you can have an array 
          that stores elements with the types number, string, boolean, and even more arrays. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what different types of array look like:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/array.png" alt="code-showing-different-types-of-arrays" class="img-center">
        <p>
          We can access the data inside arrays by their numerical position in the list, aka index. 
          Don't forget that arrays use zero-based indexing, 
          so the first element in an array is element <code> [0]</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we take the <code>stringArray</code> from above, <code>"banana"</code> 
          is the first element and we can access it using index <code>[0]</code>, <code>"car"</code> 
          is the second element and has an index of <code>[1]</code>, 
          and so on. It might sounds strange and confusing at first, but don't worry, 
          you'll get used to it! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's say we want to access the seventh element, which is <code>"wine"</code>, our code will look like this: 
        </p>
        <img src="../images/access-array.png" alt="code-showing-how-to-access-an-arrays" class="img-center">
        <br>
        <p>
          Same as arrays, objects represent a data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Objects</strong> are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, 
          a dog, a book, a house - basically anything that can be defined by a set of characteristics. 
          In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a 
          <strong>key</strong> and a <strong>value</strong> pair, stored within curly brackets <code>{ }</code>. 
          Each key acts as a label for the corresponding value.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what an object look like:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/object.png" alt="code-showing-an-object-structure" class="img-center">
        <p>
          Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed by using either dot or bracket notation. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If we take the <code>dog</code> object from above, to get the value of the <code>breed</code> key in our dog object 
          with both dot and bracket notation, our code will look like:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/access-object.png" alt="code-showing-how-to-access-an-object" class="img-center">
        <h3>Functions?</h3>
        <p>A function is a piece of code that if needed can be used multiple times in a program. 
          When developing an application, you often need to perform the same action over and over, 
          and to avoid repeating the same code multiple times, you can use a function to wrap 
          that code and reuse it as many times you need.
        </p>
        <p>A function is declared using the <code>function</code> keyword and 
          to use it you need to call it. Calling a function is also known as invoking a function. 
          To call a function, you use its name followed by arguments enclosing in parentheses. 
          The syntax of a function looks like this:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/sum-function.png" alt="javascript-sum-function" class="img-center">
        <p>
          The terms <strong>parameters</strong> and <strong>arguments</strong> are often used interchangeably. 
          However, they are essentially different. When declaring a function, you specify the parameters, 
          while when calling a function, you pass the arguments that are corresponding to the parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          I find the function concept very similar to adding a new phone number 
          to our contact list (this will be the act of creating the function). 
          E.g. Every time I want to call my mum, instead of keying her number,
          I type mum from my contact list - in programming lingo this is equal 
          to calling the function <strong>mum( )</strong>.
        </p>
