        <div class="subtitle"> Sprint 2 | Core</div>
        <br>
        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>I haven’t quite figured out my long term career plan just yet. For most part of my life I always felt out of place because I never knew what I wanted to do in life. Now I am pretty sure I want to work in Tech and that is why I am here. 
          I am hoping that Dev Academy will help me understand better in which branch of IT I want to work, or at least I am hoping I will secure a job in the sector and then I will go from there.
        </p>
        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <p>On top of what I have already covered in details in Sprint 1 “Identity, Values, and Strengths” blog, I think that my strengths and limitations could be sum up with curiosity and perfectionism. 
          Those are definitely my number one strengths but at the same time they can also have a negative impact on me. In fact, I can get caught up on details and sometimes I don’t realize when it’s time to move on. </p>
        
        <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>I am not great at communicating and I really struggle to externalise and talk openly about my feelings. I am a people pleaser and I always want everyone to be happy, most of the time at my expenses. <br>
          I want to get better at communicating and I am really hoping that the Core part of this program will help me with this. I want to get to a point where I am confident enough to tell other people how I am feeling and start seeing myself as a priority number one, even if this means disappoint people from time to time. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
        <p>I have started to plan my week ahead. Every Sunday night I sit down at my desk for about 15-20 minutes and plan for the following week. I quickly scroll through the Sprint material to have a general idea of the topics I will need to cover on each day and I write a plan in my diary. </p>
        <p>As of working with other students I am sure that this won't be a big issue. I generally get along with most people and I am a very reliable person, so if I say I will be completing a task, then be assured that the task will be done.</p>
        <p>When things will start to get complicated and stressful I will have to find a way to relax, which is normally going for a walk or doing yoga or pilates. And then of course I promise I will ask for help.</p>
        
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>I am a very independent person (and also a bit stubborn!) and I don’t like to ask for help, so this is definitely something I need to work on. 
          I think it is ok to try and figure out things on my own at times, but I also need to learn when it is time to ask for help, especially when I have been stuck on the same problem for half a day!</p>
        
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>I don’t expect too much from the Facilitation team. I would like them to be as clear as possible when it 
          comes to assignments and projects. And of course be available when we need help, and so far everyone has been super helpful and engaging. </p>
       
        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
        <p>For the next 4 months I don’t have any other commitments other then Dev Academy! 
          At the moment I am still filling in at my old job, with the team being short staffed but I am resigning once Bootcamp starts.
