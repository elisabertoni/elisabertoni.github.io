        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <div class="subtitle"> Sprint 3 | Core</div>
        <br>
        <p>There is an ongoing debate between the importance of Cognitive Intelligence (IQ) vs. Emotional Intelligence (EQ).
          IQ is still recognized as an important element of success, particularly when it comes to academic achievement. But today experts recognize that IQ is not the only determinant of life success. So, in recent decades, researchers have expanded the definition of intelligence to include a wider set of skills, and the concept of Emotional Intelligence (EI) has emerged as a way to describe another set of thinking skills.
        </p>
        <h3>But what is Emotional Intelligence exactly? </h3>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, as well as recognize and influence the emotions of those around you. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behaviour. 
        </p>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes:
           <div class="blog-ul">
              <ul>
              <li>Self-awareness: the ability to not only understand your strengths and weaknesses, but to recognize your emotions and the effect they have on you and your team’s performance</li>
              <li> Self-management: the ability to manage your emotions, particularly in stressful situations, and maintain a positive outlook despite setbacks. It's important to remember to pause, breathe, collect yourself, and do whatever it takes to manage your emotions in order to better respond to stress and adversity.</li>
              <li>Social awareness: the ability to recognize others’ emotions and the dynamics in play within your organization. People who excel in social awareness practice empathy.</li>
              <li>Relationship management: the ability to influence, coach, and mentor others, and resolve conflict effectively. Some prefer to avoid conflict, but it’s important to properly address issues as they arise.</li>
            </ul>
          </div> 
        </p>
        <h3>IQ vs. EQ</h3>
        <p>IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient and refers to a person’s intellectual ability and potential, while Emotional intelligence refers to a person's ability to recognize and regulate emotion, and to use social awareness in problem-solving.
        </p> 
        <p>IQ and EQ utilise different assessments to measure intelligence. IQ score is measured through a standardized test and those first emerged to assess cognitive abilities in school children. On the other side, EQ tests have been introduced more recently to assess emotional abilities.
        </p>
        <p>Historically, IQ was viewed as the primary determinant of success. People with high IQs were assumed to be destined for a life of accomplishment and achievement, and in fact a high IQ score was often linked to better academic performance, higher salaries, and better job performance.
        </p>
        <p>However, newer studies have showed that IQ does not necessarily determine success. You can have a high IQ and attain little success in life, or you can have an IQ on the lower side and do very well. 
        <br>Both IQ and EQ can dramatically affect a person’s quality of life and accomplishments. Understanding and developing both kinds of intelligence may be your best bet for increasing success in your life - whatever success means for you!
        </p> 
        <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
        <p>Over the years, Emotional Intelligence has evolved into a must-have skill as it can help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you.
        </p>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence has been linked to job success and more satisfying relationships. There’s also evidence that emotional intelligence may help you handle stress.
        </p>
        <p>Recent research have showed that Emotional Intelligence is the strongest predictor of performance and have reported that employees with high emotional intelligence are more likely to stay calm under pressure, resolve conflict effectively, and respond to co-workers with empathy.
        </p>
        <p>Another research has found that individuals with strong leadership potential also tend to be more emotionally intelligent, suggesting that a high EQ is an important quality for business leaders and managers.
        </p>
        <h3>Can you improve your EQ?</h3>
        <p>There are actions you can take to boost your emotional intelligence. Methods include:
          <div class="blog-ul">
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Practice mindfulness</strong>: is the practice of purposely focusing your attention on the present moment without judgment.</li>
              <li><strong>Journaling</strong>: at the end of the day, reflect on what happened, whether positive or negative. By writing your thoughts down, you can spot specific patterns about your behaviours and reactions.</li>
              <li><strong>Practice active listening</strong>: This helps to become more emotionally intelligent. Try to focus on what the speaker is saying and show that you’re engaged by paraphrasing and using other non-verbal cues like nodding. </li>
              <li><strong>Pay attention to your emotions</strong>: Pay attention to your emotions: When you feel a particularly strong emotion, whether it’s a positive or negative one, take a second and consider why you’re feeling this way and what might have triggered it.</li>
              <li><strong>Reading</strong>: studies show that reading gives you a chance to immerse yourself in the experiences of other people (whether those people really exist or are fictional characters doesn't matter) and this can improve empathy.</li>
            </ul>
