        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

        <h3>Have you heard of Neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          The term <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> refers to the brain's ability to change, reorganize, and grow 
          neural networks. <em>Plasticity</em> refers to the brain's malleability (or ability to change), 
          and <em>Neuro</em> refers to neurons, the nerve cells that are the building blocks 
          of the brain and nervous system.
          <br>For a long period of time, people used to believe that the brain became fixed after 
          a certain age (generally early childhood). Now, newer research has revealed that our brain 
          can continue developing and changing throughout life in response to experience 
          and learning. Like a physical muscle, the brain gets stronger the more you use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many benefits of brain neuroplasticity. Allowing your brain to adapt and change helps promote:
        <div class="blog-ul">
          <ul>
            <li>The ability to learn new things;</li>
            <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries;</li>
            <li>Strengthening areas where function is lost or has declined;</li>
            <li>Improvements that can boost brain fitness.</li>  
          </ul>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are steps you can take to help encourage your brain to adapt and change at any age, such as:
        </p>
        <div class="blog-ul">
          <ul>
            <li>Exercising regularly;</li>
            <li>Learning a new language;</li>
            <li>Making some music and learning how to play an instrument;</li>
            <li>Traveling and exploring new places;</li>
            <li>Creating art and other creative pursuits;</li>
            <li>Reading;</li>
            <li>Getting plenty of rest and sleep;</li>
            <li>Practicing Mindfulness.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>And what about Growth Mindset?</h3>
        <p>
          The term <strong><em>“Growth Mindset”</em></strong> refers to the idea that you can always change and grow. 
          This term came about in the early 2000s by researcher Carol Dweck. Having a growth 
          mindset means that you believe that your skills, abilities, and outlook can 
          change over time as you expose yourself to new experiences and 
          practice new skills.
          <br>The science behind growth mindset is neuroplasticity, which is the reason
          we can develop skills and knowledge through effort, practice, and persistence.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Carol Dweck, individuals who believe their talents can be 
          developed through hard work have a growth mindset and studies have shown that 
          this people tend to achieve more and have more success than those with a more fixed mindset.
          In a <strong>fixed mindset</strong> people believe their basic abilities, 
          their intelligence and their talents, are just fixed traits.  
        </p>
        <p>
          To develop a growth mindset, you can:
        </p>
        <div class="blog-ul">
          <ul>
            <li>Believe you can learn new information and take action to do so;</li>
            <li>Focus on trying new things without focusing on the outcome;</li>
            <li>Put a large amount of time into learning new things;</li>
            <li>Keep trying, even when you have challenges;</li>
            <li>Keep trying, even when you fail;</li>
            <li>Embrace failure;</li>
            <li>Develop new methods for learning or completing tasks;</li>
            <li>and much more...</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Personal reflections</h3>
        <p>
          The terms Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset are new to me and it was 
          definitely an interesting reading. 
          <br>I am pretty sure I tend to have more of a fixed mindset, rather than growth. 
          I guess I sort of new that to get better at something, you have to keep practicing. 
          But I have always thought that some people were naturally gifted and better 
          than others at certain things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I think that I was brought up with this mentality.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was at primary school, my best friend was really talented, 
          super smart and she always did extremely well in school. On the other 
          side I never liked school and I always struggled with learning. 
          <br>I remember my parents used to say to me all the time things like: “she 
          (referred to my best friend) is so smart and studying comes so easily 
          to her because she comes from a very intelligent family. Her mum is a lawyer 
          and her dad an engineer, and her sister is a genius who gets A+ in all the subjects."
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, I think that deep down I thought I wasn't smart or intelligent enough 
          and so there was no point for me to try and learn something as I was never going to 
          be as good as my best friend.
          <br> This little story from my childhood is a good example of why Carol Dweck 
          thinks it is so important to introduce the concepts of Neuroplasticity and 
          Growth Mindset to kids. In this way students can understand 
          from a young age that our brains aren’t static, and through repeated practice 
          and challenges we can make our brains stronger and smarter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next step for me is definitely trying to adopt more of a growth mindset, 
          especially now that I am in the process of learning so many new concepts 
          and I am surrounded by so many challenges daily. I need to understand that 
          setbacks are a part of the learning process and that difficulty is simultaneous 
          to growth. 
          <br>I think that shifting from a fixed to a growth mindset will be essential 
          to succeed on this journey with Dev Academy and in order to pursue a career in tech.
